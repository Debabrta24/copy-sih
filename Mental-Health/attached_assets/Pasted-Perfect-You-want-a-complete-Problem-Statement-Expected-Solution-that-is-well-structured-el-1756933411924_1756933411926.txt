# üìù Problem Statement

**Context:**
In recent years, mental health challenges among college students in India have reached alarming proportions. Issues such as **academic stress, exam anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep disorders, loneliness, and social isolation** are increasingly reported across campuses. The situation is more severe in **rural and semi-urban institutions**, where access to professional mental health support is limited and stigma surrounding counselling remains high.

**Problem Faced:**
Despite growing awareness, students face several barriers in accessing timely and stigma-free mental health support:

1. **Absence of structured systems:** Most institutions lack a centralized, scalable, and systematic psychological intervention mechanism.
2. **Delayed detection:** Early warning signs of stress or mental health decline are often overlooked due to lack of preventive screening.
3. **Stigma and under-utilization:** Existing counselling centres are under-used, as students fear being judged or labelled by peers.
4. **Lack of cultural and regional adaptation:** Most available digital apps are Western-centric, generic, and not aligned with the Indian socio-cultural and linguistic context.
5. **No policy insights for institutions:** There is no institutional dashboard to track mental health trends, plan targeted interventions, or allocate counselling resources effectively.

**Need for Intervention:**
There is a pressing requirement for a **tailored digital mental health platform** that is:

* **Accessible, confidential, and stigma-free** for students.
* **Culturally contextualized** with regional languages and localized psychoeducational resources.
* **Integrated with existing institutional frameworks**, counsellors, and helplines.
* **Analytically driven**, providing anonymized insights to administrators for policy making.

Without such an intervention, mental health issues will remain invisible until they escalate into crises, leading to **poor academic outcomes, increased dropouts, and compromised student well-being**.
