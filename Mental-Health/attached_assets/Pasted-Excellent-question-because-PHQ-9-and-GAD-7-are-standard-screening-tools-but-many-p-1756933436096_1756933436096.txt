Excellent question 👌 — because **PHQ-9** and **GAD-7** are **standard screening tools**, but many people confuse them with diagnosis. I’ll explain step by step how to **use them correctly** in your project (like in SIH).

---

# 🧾 1. What are PHQ-9 & GAD-7?

* **PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9):**
  A 9-question tool for assessing **depression symptoms** over the past **2 weeks**.

* **GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7):**
  A 7-question tool for assessing **anxiety symptoms** over the past **2 weeks**.

⚠️ **Important:**
They are **screening tools, not diagnostic tools.**
They help you understand **symptom severity** and decide whether referral is needed.

# 🧮 2. How They Work (Scoring System)

## 📍 PHQ-9 (0–27 scale)

Each of 9 items is scored:

* 0 = Not at all
* 1 = Several days
* 2 = More than half the days
* 3 = Nearly every day

👉 Add up the 9 responses for a **total score (0–27)**.

**Severity Bands:**

* 0–4 → Minimal / none
* 5–9 → Mild
* 10–14 → Moderate
* 15–19 → Moderately severe
* 20–27 → Severe

---

## 📍 GAD-7 (0–21 scale)

Each of 7 items is scored the same way (0–3).

👉 Add up the 7 responses for a **total score (0–21)**.

**Severity Bands:**

* 0–4 → Minimal
* 5–9 → Mild
* 10–14 → Moderate
* 15–21 → Severe

# ⚙️ 3. How to Use in Your App/System

### Step 1: **Consent & Context**

* Tell the student: “This is a short self-check, not a diagnosis. It will help us understand how you’ve been feeling.”

### Step 2: **Ask Questions**

* Show 9 questions (PHQ-9) or 7 questions (GAD-7).
* Provide radio buttons (0–3).
* Use **simple language + regional translations**.

### Step 3: **Calculate Score**

* Sum the responses.
* Place in severity band.

### Step 4: **Give Feedback (non-medical)**

Example:

* If score = 6 on PHQ-9 → “You may be experiencing mild low mood. Try the relaxation guides in our app. If symptoms persist, consider talking to a counsellor.”
* If score = 17 on PHQ-9 → “Your score suggests significant distress. We strongly recommend booking a session with the campus counsellor or calling a helpline.”

### Step 5: **Escalation in Crisis**

* If student answers “3 = Nearly every day” to **Q9 of PHQ-9** (about self-harm/suicidal thoughts), the system must **immediately trigger crisis protocol** (show helpline + alert counsellor).

# 💡 4. Example (PHQ-9 JSON Storage)

```json
{
  "tool": "PHQ9",
  "answers": [2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2],
  "score": 12,
  "risk_band": "moderate",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-03T20:10:00Z"
}
```

# ✅ 5. Best Practices

* Always add a **disclaimer**: *“This is a wellness screening, not a medical diagnosis. Please consult a professional if you are concerned.”*
* Keep results **confidential**.
* Provide **next steps**: coping strategies, booking link, helpline.
* Never show raw “you have depression/anxiety.” Instead: *“You may be experiencing stress that could benefit from support.”*

---

👉 So, in your SIH project:

* Use **PHQ-9 + GAD-7** as **screening + triage tools**.
* Combine scores with your **AI-guided first-aid chatbot**.
* Trigger escalation when needed.

Would you like me to **give you a ready-made questionnaire format (all PHQ-9 & GAD-7 questions with scoring options)** that you can **directly put in your app/web UI**?
