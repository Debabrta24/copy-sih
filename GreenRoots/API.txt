# 3. Set these as environment variables in your deployment
# 4. For Replit: Use the Secrets tab in your Repl
# 5. Test each API endpoint to verify connectivity

# ===== PRIORITY ORDER =====
# Weather: OpenWeatherMap → WeatherAPI → NASA POWER
# Soil: SoilGrids → NASA POWER
# Market: Web Scraping → Realistic Pricing → Gemini AI
# Pest Detection: Plant.id → PlantNet → iNaturalist
# Crop Recommendations: Real data + Science → Gemini AI

# ===== COST OPTIMIZATION =====
# - Start with free tiers
# - Monitor usage in API dashboards
# - Implement caching (already built-in)
# - Use fallback APIs to prevent failures
# - Scale up paid plans based on user traffic
